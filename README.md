================

This repository contains code to reproduce the results of ''Epidemiological dynamics of Ebola outbreaks,'' DOI 10.7554/eLife.03908

While there has been some tidying compared to the raw research code, it is indended that a more user-friendly version of the general methods will shortly be released via EpiStruct (http://epistruct.sourceforge.net/).
